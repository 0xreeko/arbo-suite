# Fullstack Boilerplate V2
This boilerplate is an improvement of my previous boilerplate with tool I use for Web3 projects, where one can choose whether to use Context or Redux depending of a project's size.

## Dependencies
- TypeScript(React) > frontend
- TailwindCSS > component styling
- DotEnv > mask key variables
- OpenZeppelin > industry standard utility lib for Solidity
- Moralis > blockchain & database interaction
- Ethers > blockchain interaction (prod/dev env)
- Hardhat > local dev env
- Web3modal > modal for web3 wallet selection (UX) e.g. Metamask, TrustWallet
## Structure
Src/ contains three folders that I've included:

- ðŸ—‚ Components > host all the components that make up the dApp
- âš– Context > host state management for data processing
- â›“ Hooks > may inc. my custom Hooks that I find useful for dApp development (NOTE: I'll add more occassionally)
