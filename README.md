# Fullstack Boilerplate V2

This boilerplate is an improvement of my previous boilerplate that I utilised for Web3 projects - consists of my favourite frontend technologies along with industry standard tools for development, like Hardhat and Ethers.js.

## Tech Used: 
- ReactJS(JavaScript) > frontend
- TailwindCSS > component styling
- DotEnv > mask key variables
- Moralis

## Structure
Src/ contains three folders that I've included:

- Components > hosts all the components that make up the dApp
- Context > hosts logic for processing
- Hooks > my custom Hooks that I find useful for dApp development

[PS] This repo is subject to change to ensure that it allows for quick plugin 'n' play to streamline the development process.
